A new GA release for the macOS WARP client is now available on the [stable releases downloads page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/).

This release contains minor fixes, improvements, and new features, including the ability to manage WARP client connectivity for all devices in your fleet using an [external signal](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/settings/emergency-disconnect/#set-up-external-emergency-disconnect).

**Changes and improvements**

  * The [Local Domain Fallback](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/route-traffic/local-domains/) feature has been fixed for devices running WARP client version 2025.4.929.0 and newer. Previously, these devices could experience failures with Local Domain Fallback unless a fallback server was explicitly configured. This configuration is no longer a requirement for the feature to function correctly.
  * [Proxy mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/modes/#local-proxy-mode) now supports transparent HTTP proxying in addition to CONNECT-based proxying.
  * Added a new feature to manage WARP client connectivity for all devices using an [external signal](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/settings/emergency-disconnect/#set-up-external-emergency-disconnect). This feature allows administrators to send a global signal from an on-premises HTTPS endpoint that force disconnects or reconnects all WARP clients in an account based on configuration set on the endpoint.
