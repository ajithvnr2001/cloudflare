Review the definitions for terms used across Cloudflare's Workflows documentation.

Term| Definition  
---|---  
Durable Execution| "Durable Execution" is a programming model that allows applications to execute reliably, automatically persist state, retry, and be resistant to errors caused by API, network or even machine/infrastructure failures. Cloudflare Workflows provide a way to build and deploy applications that align with this model.  
Event| The event that triggered the Workflow instance. A `WorkflowEvent` may contain optional parameters (data) that a Workflow can operate on.  
instance| A specific instance (running, paused, errored) of a Workflow. A Workflow can have a potentially infinite number of instances.  
step| A step is self-contained, individually retryable component of a Workflow. Steps may emit (optional) state that allows a Workflow to persist and continue from that step, even if a Workflow fails due to a network or infrastructure issue. A Workflow can have one or more steps up to the [step limit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/reference/limits/).  
Workflow| The named Workflow definition, associated with a single Workers script.
